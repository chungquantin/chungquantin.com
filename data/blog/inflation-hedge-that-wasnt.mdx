Out of all the reasons to be bullish on Bitcoin, claims that it is an inflation hedge is the most puzzling one I
have encountered. The argument usually makes a case that bitcoin is similar to digital gold
(which [we largely agree with](/blog/bitcoin-as-digital-gold)), and traditional wisdom has it that gold is an
inflation hedge.

That gold has been tossed around as an inflation hedge flies in the face of contradicting data. Historically gold
has had a weak and unreliable relationship to realized inflation as measured by the CPI. The relationship even in
the 70s and early 80s where gold was viewed as a reliable inflation hedge was weak and has become weaker since. The
full sample correlation of gold returns to the change in CPI is less than 10% and a rolling correlation shows that
it is fairly unstable.  It is a piece of traditional wisdom that is simply false, yet it is still being propagated
as true despite decades of evidence to the contrary.

You know what is an actual inflation hedge? Inflation derivatives! Breakeven Inflation Swaps.  Treasury
Inflation-Protected Securities. Turns out, you can actually trade inflation directly! Shocking, I know.

Inflation derivatives are usually OTC instruments that require ISDA agreements in place and are not the easiest
instrument to trade. So it is understandable if retail investors need to look to assets they can trade such as
listed commodities, equities, or real estate to protect their wealth. Even then, the best inflation hedge available
to retail investors is usually fixed-rate nominal debt. In other words, if you are a homeowner with a fixed rate
mortgage at nominal rates below the prevailing inflation rate, you actually have a fairly great hedge in place that
is benefiting from the higher inflation. This is especially true for US homeowners given the prevalence of 30-year
mortgages with fixed rates that were as low as 4% in the beginning of this year.

To make things worse, assets without cash flow such as non-dividend paying stocks, gold, digital assets, etc. are
more likely to be hurt by persistently high inflation given that it makes rate hikes more likely. Since the
entirety of the value of assets without interim cash flows is in the terminal value, any steepening or rise across
the yield curve would increase discount rates, i.e. lowering net present value. This is one of the primary reasons
why they have performed so poorly in 2022 as the central banks have acted quite aggressively in tightening of their
monetary policy to address inflation.

Bitcoin is a store of value similar to digital gold, but for the same reasons that gold isn’t an inflation hedge,
neither is bitcoin. Trading them for inflation protection makes little sense, even more so when there are pure
inflation instruments available to institutional entities and superior ones to the average retail investor.
