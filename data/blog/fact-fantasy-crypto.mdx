If what you know about crypto and blockchain is from mainstream media, chances are, like me when I first read about
it, you learned it all wrong.
Allow me to explain. How many times have you heard that bitcoin is a "cryptocurrency"? What about "blockchain"?

it is a pyramid scheme. ponzi, assets dont exist.

Neither of those words appear in the Bitcoin whitepaper. Verify for yourself [here](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf).

Financial Times has been calling Bitcoin a modern-day "tulip mania" for over a decade by now.
