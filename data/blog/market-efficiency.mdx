If like me you were taught market efficiency in school, you probably told something like this:

*"[The efficient-market hypothesis (EMH)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis) is a hypothesis
in financial economics that states that asset prices
reflect all available information. A direct implication is that it is impossible to "beat the market" consistently
on a risk-adjusted basis since market prices should only react to new information."*

And it would immediately go on to define three forms of market efficiency:

***Weak**, **semi-strong**, and **strong-form** tests In Fama's influential 1970 review paper, he categorized empirical
tests of efficiency into "weak-form", "semi-strong-form", and "strong-form" tests.*

*These categories of tests refer to the information set used in the statement "prices reflect all available
information." Weak-form tests study the information contained in historical prices. Semi-strong form tests study
information (beyond historical prices) which is publicly available. Strong-form tests regard private information.*

#### Join hypothesis problem

Ultimately testing for market efficiency is impossible since you will always have a
[joint hypothesis problem]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_hypothesis_problem). Even models widely in use such
as Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) wouldn't pass the simplest empirical test. Yet the investment banking industry
squarely relies on CAPM because bankers are not quite concerned with the fundamental valuation of securities, but rather
what fee they can collect for providing their services to you. Sell-side models are simple and primarily concerned
with linear pricing of securities relative to other assets.

#### So how efficient are the markets?

Market efficiency is something you only really encounter in school. The entire hedge fund industry is only possible
on the premise being otherwise. The market efficiency even in its weak form
doesn't stand any empirical tests. Fama's own student, wrote a [seminal paper](https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~lpederse/papers/ValMomEverywhere.pdf)
showing that a factor as simple as momentum, which solely uses past prices, can consistently provide excess
returns.

Critical in the teaching of all asset pricing models in school is the assumption of **no arbitrage**. Meaning there
is no truly risk-free money to be made in the markets. This is where market efficiency truly shines.

#### The markets are (almost) efficient in pricing linearities.

What the hell does that mean? It means that there exists combination of assets that produce payoffs equal to other
assets. A long call plus a short put is a forward. A covered call is a collateralized short put. Index futures basis
rarely gets out of hand versus its underlying assets. There are numerous market linearities that are consistent and
provide no opportunity for true arbitrage. That is where the market is almost always efficient. It is quite rare to
see true arbitrage in the market. If you think you
have discovered true arbitrage, you
should harder for [multiple reasons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limits_to_arbitrage) where actual realization of
the profit might not be possible.
