## Intro

The first iteration of my blog [kaveh.page](https://kaveh.page) was generated by awesome and lightweight [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). As I started learning JS frameworks starting with React decided to give it an over-engineered solution using a 
few technologies I was learning, Next.js and Tailwind.

As I have taken on my freelancing work, it was long-overdue to have a more professional looking website that also acted
as my personal learning playground.

## Tech stack

This blog is hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/?ref=kaveh.page), and was absolutely overengineered with 
[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/?ref=kaveh.page), 
[Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/?ref=kaveh.page), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/?ref=kaveh.page), and uses 
[Umami](https://umami.is/?ref=kaveh.page) Cloud for analytics.  

A huge thanks to [Timothy Lin](https://twitter.com/timlrxx) for the original starter blog
and [Tuan Anh Huynh](https://www.leohuynh.dev/) for the updated version!
