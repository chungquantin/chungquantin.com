Forked from [kaveh.page](https://kaveh.page). Thanks to my fellow Kaveh from Polkadot Blockchain Academy Singapore for this amazing blog template.

## Tech stack

This blog is hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/?ref=kaveh.page), and was absolutely overengineered with
[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/?ref=kaveh.page),
[Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/?ref=kaveh.page), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/?ref=kaveh.page), and uses
[Umami](https://umami.is/?ref=kaveh.page) Cloud for analytics. Before you flame me for using Next.js for a static
blog that could've been done with plain HTML/CSS, I would say that this is more of a playground for learning. The
website is rendered server-side, served statically, and has high
Lighthouse score.

A huge thanks to [Timothy Lin](https://twitter.com/timlrxx) for the original starter blog
and [Tuan Anh Huynh](https://www.leohuynh.dev/) for the updated version!
